This is a small lib to generate Japanese names, toponyms, etc.

The full list of joyo-kanji with meanings and spellings was loaded from wikipedia webpage.
After parsing and handling raw data, it was put into JSON file with meanings and spellings only.
The lib loads this file and generates names with length of custom set-up range.

in Program.cs there's an example of name generator. Just press any key, and new names will be generated. To exit press Esc.
